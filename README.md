# DSCPullServerContainer

Code used to generate the DSC Pull server container image during [PSConfEU2018](https://github.com/psconfeu/2018)

The image is published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bgelens/dscpullservercontainer/) and requires an RS4+ build of a Windows Container host.

```bash
docker pull bgelens/dscpullservercontainer
```
